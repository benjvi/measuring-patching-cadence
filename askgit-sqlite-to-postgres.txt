-- first, use askgit to export git data to sqlite file: `askgit export askgit-commits-stats-db.sqlite3 -e commits -e "select hash as id,* from commits;" -e stats -e "SELECT commits.hash as "commit_id", stats.file_path as "file", stats.additions, stats.deletions FROM commits, stats('', commits.hash)"`
-- then load the data into postgres based on the config in this file: `pgloader askgit-sqlite-to-postgres.txt`

load database
  from 'askgit-commits-stats-db.sqlite3'
  into pgsql://<POSTGRES HOST VALUE>:<POSTGRES PORT VALUE>/<POSTGRES DB NAME>

with create tables

cast type num to timestamptz using sqlite-timestamp-to-timestamp;
